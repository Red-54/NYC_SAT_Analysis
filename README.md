# NYC Public Schools SAT Performance Evaluation

## Project Overview

This project delves into the SAT performance of New York City public schools, offering valuable insights into school achievements and potential areas for improvement. The analysis leverages Python and the Pandas library to uncover trends and patterns across boroughs and individual schools.

## Data Source

The analysis is based on the `schools.csv` dataset, which encompasses information on NYC public schools, including:

* School name
* Borough
* Building code
* Average SAT scores (Math, Reading, Writing)
* Percentage of students taking the SAT

## Analysis and Key Findings

The project investigates several key aspects of SAT performance:

* **Missing Values:** Ensuring data quality by identifying and handling missing values within the dataset.
* **High-Performing Schools (Math):** Pinpointing and ranking schools achieving average math scores above 640.
* **Top 10 Schools (Overall):** Determining the top 10 schools based on their combined SAT scores (Math + Reading + Writing).
* **Borough Performance:** Analyzing average SAT scores and standard deviations for each borough to understand performance variations and identify boroughs with significant score disparities.

## Insights and Applications

The findings from this project hold significant value for:

* **Education professionals** seeking to identify high-performing schools and best practices.
* **Policymakers** aiming to understand borough-level performance differences and allocate resources effectively.
* **School administrators** looking to improve their school's SAT performance and address performance gaps.
* **Parents and students** interested in evaluating school options and understanding educational trends.

## Tools and Technologies

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Data Analysis Library:** Pandas
* **Numerical Computation Library:** NumPy

## Running the Analysis

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Ensure you have Python and the required libraries (Pandas and NumPy) installed.
3. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook file (`School.txt`) to execute the analysis and explore the results.

## Visualization Opportunities

While the current project primarily focuses on code-based analysis, incorporating data visualization would greatly enhance the presentation and understanding of the findings. Charts and graphs could effectively communicate key insights to a broader audience.

## Future Development Possibilities

* Explore correlations between SAT scores and factors such as school demographics, socioeconomic indicators, and educational programs.
* Develop interactive visualizations using libraries like Plotly or Bokeh for deeper data exploration.
* Create a web application or dashboard to present the analysis results and visualizations in a user-friendly and accessible manner.

## Conclusion

This project exemplifies the effectiveness of data analysis in comprehending educational patterns and guiding informed decision-making. The insights gleaned from this evaluation of NYC public schools' SAT
